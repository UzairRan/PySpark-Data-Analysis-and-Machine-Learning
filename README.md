## 📊 Part 1: Dataset1

1. **Load and Describe the Data**
   - Loaded the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
   - Provided a description of the DataFrame structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Created a new DataFrame by removing rows with missing values.

3. **Summary Statistics and Visualization**
   - Calculated summary statistics for feature 'X1'.
   - Generated a histogram and boxplot for data visualization.

4. **Data Filtering**
   - Counted rows where 'X1' > 50 and 'Y1' = 1.

5. **Model Building and Evaluation**
   - Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with 'Y1' as the target label.

## 📊 Part 2: Dataset2

1. **Load and Describe the Data**
   - Loaded another dataset into a Spark DataFrame and described its structure.

2. **Column Removal**
   - Removed the 'X10' column from the DataFrame.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Explored the relationship between features 'X2' and 'X8' using a scatter plot.

4. **SQL Queries**
   - Used Spark SQL to filter and display data based on specific conditions.

5. **Model Building**
   - Built Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models to predict 'X8'.

## 🏁 Conclusion

- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were built and evaluated. Logistic Regression achieved higher accuracy compared to Random Forest.
- Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models were built, with Lasso Regression showing better performance.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Explore feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Experiment with other machine learning models and ensemble methods.

## 🔧 Technical Justifications

- Chose Logistic Regression and Random Forest for their effectiveness in classification tasks.
- Used Linear and Lasso Regression for regression tasks due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

## 🚀 Suggestions for Further Improvement

- Implement feature scaling and advanced models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) and Neural Networks.
- Utilize regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
